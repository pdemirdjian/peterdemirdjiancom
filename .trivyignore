# Trivy ignore file
# Add vulnerability IDs (CVE, GHSA, etc.) that you want to ignore
# Each line should contain one vulnerability ID
# Use comments to explain why a vulnerability is ignored

# Example of ignoring a specific CVE:
# CVE-2022-1234

# Example of ignoring a GHSA:
# GHSA-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx

# You can also ignore vulnerabilities for specific files:
# CVE-2022-1234 package.json

# Ignore development dependencies vulnerabilities that don't affect production
# (uncomment and adjust as needed)

# Note: Be very careful when ignoring vulnerabilities
# Always document the reason and ensure it's safe to ignore
